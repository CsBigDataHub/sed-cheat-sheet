This is sed - Unix Stream Editor - cheat sheet. I created it because I wanted
to master sed inside out. With this cheat sheet I could have the whole sed
reference in front of me and this allowed me to quicker learn all the
commands.

I explain a lot more about how and why I created it in my article "Sed - UNIX
Stream Editor - Cheat Sheet". This article can be read here:
